# Social Status

A little python script that lives in my terminal and allows me to post to multiple social media sites at once.

Currently supports posts with or without images on:

1) Mastodon
2) Bluesky

It will automatically resize images if they exceed the maximum size by bluesky. I dont currently have max characters enforced.


I may add more sites, if I used them. You are welcome to fork it and use it for yourself.
